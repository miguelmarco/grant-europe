University Paris-Sud is among the 40 top universities worldwide in the
2013 Shanghai ranking, and is one of the two best French research
universities. With about 27000 students, 1800 permanent teaching staff
and 1300 permanent research scientists from national research
organisations (CNRS, Inserm, INRA, Inria), it is the largest campus in
France. Since 2006, scientists from the University were awarded two
Fields medals, one Nobel Prize and a number of other international
(European Inventor Award 2013, Wolf Prize 2010, Holweck Prize 2009,
Japan prize 2007) and national prizes.  The Université Paris-Sud has a
complete array of competences, ranging from the purest of exact
sciences to clinical practices in medicine, covering life and health
sciences, legal sciences and economics. Research at the Université
Paris-Sud, an essential part of academic understanding, is
complemented by research activities with a high valorisation
potential. Research contracts and partnership with companies make the
Université Paris-Sud a key actor and a major player in French
research.  The University is located close to the Plateau de Saclay,
the largest cluster of public and private R\&D institutions in France
(with ca. 16000 research staff), and is one of the core members of the
University Paris Saclay – a world class university and a
world-renowned research and innovation hub.

In the context of this project, the Université Paris Saclay is the
home of one of the largest group of Sage developers worldwide. It's a
member of the Open Source Thematic Group of the Systematic Paris
Region Systems and ICT Cluster. The University also hosts a major
research group working on proof assistants (Coq), which naturally
opens the door for reaching toward this neighbor community.

% The main participants have accumulated 15 years of experience of
% collaborative open source software development for mathematics
% leadership, and community animation.

\TODO{Comments by Olivier Chapuis}
Paris Sud also hosts the WILDER platform, an experimental wall-sized
high-resolution interactive touch-screen for conducting research on
collaborative human-computer interaction and the visualization of
large datasets.
