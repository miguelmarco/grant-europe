The University of Oxford is in the top ten universities worldwide in the Shanghai 2013 and 2014
rankings (the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford are the only non-US university there).
It employs over 10,000 staff and has a student population of over 21,000.
Most staff are directly appointed and managed by one of the University’s 130 departments or
other units within a highly devolved operational structure - this includes 5,900 ‘academic related’
staff (postgraduate research, computing, senior library, and administrative staff) and
2,820 ‘support’ staff (including clerical, library, technical, and manual staff). There are also
over 1,600 academic staff (professors, readers, lecturers), whose appointments are in the
main overseen by a combination of broader divisional and local faculty board/departmental
structures. 

The Department of Computer Science is one of the longest established
Computer Science departments in the country. Formerly known as the
University Computing Laboratory, it is home to a community of world-class research and
teaching. Research activities encompass core Computer Science, as well as Security,
Algorithms, computational biology, quantum computing, computational linguistics,
information systems, software verification and software engineering. 

The department is home to undergraduates, full-time and part-time Master's
students, and has a strong doctoral programme.  Students are highly skilled and
motivated, and as practice shows, easily start contributing to open-source
projects such as Sagemath.
