The University of Southampton (UoS) is one of the leading universities
in the United Kingdom, was founded in 1952 and is a member of
prestigious Russell Group of UK Universities. UoS has more than 19,000
undergraduate students and 4,000 postgraduates and is an excellent
venue for conducting cutting-edge research and for providing high
quality education. The university is truly international, drawing
students from over 130 different countries and benefiting from a wide
and varied culture. It is ranked in the top 1\% of universities
worldwide (QS world university rankings 2014-15) and in the top 15 of
research led universities in the UK, and is participating in a high
number of collaborative research projects and related initiatives. UoS
has a successful track record of industrial collaborations and is at
the centre of a cluster of local high technology companies. It has an
enviable track record in the generation of patentable work, with a
portfolio of over 350 patents. To ensure the impact of its research
projects, University of Southampton’s Research \& Innovation Services
(R\&IS) is responsible for professional protection of IP and supporting
commercial development with industry. R\&IS has had considerable
success, licensing annual revenue in excess of \EUR{1}million and launching
twelve successful spin-out companies since 2000.  UoS has a strong
track record of working in European projects, especially within the
Framework Programme. The EC 6th FP7 Monitoring Report ranked UoS 17th
out of all higher and secondary education organisations for number of
FP7 participations during 2007-2012. Throughout the FP7 UoS has
received \EUR{132M} in research grants and has been involved in 319
projects, including 63 ICT and 8 INFRASTRUCTURES Collaborative Projects. In 2013/14
alone UoS has received over \euro181.5M in research grants and contracts,
including over \euro16.3M from the European Commission.

The Faculty of Engineering and the Environment (FEE) is one of the
lead engineering faculties in Europe, educating a range of
professionals and generating research of the highest
quality. Southampton's world-leading engineering ranking is confirmed
by being ranked first in the UK for the volume and quality of the
research in Electronic Engineering, Electrical Engineering and
General Engineering in the latest Research Excellence Framework (REF)
2014.

FEE brings together a wide range of disciplines, offering
undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in audiology and
environmental science as well as acoustical, civil and environmental,
mechanical, and aeronautical/astronautical engineering and ship
science. It consists of 370 research postgraduate students and 340
academic and research staff. FEE also hosts the University Technology
Centres and Research Framework Agreements with key partners including:
Airbus, Rolls-Royce, Lloyd’s Register, Microsoft and Network Rail. FEE
has a strong background in working on international research projects,
including 84 EU FP7 projects worth over \euro 28M.  In 2013/14 only
FEE has received about \euro50M in research grants and contracts, of
which over \euro1.7M from EU funding programmes.
