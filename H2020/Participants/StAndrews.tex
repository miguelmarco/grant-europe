The Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Computational Algebra (CIRCA)
fosters research at the interface of Mathematics and Computer Science including
abstract and algorithmic algebra and combinatorics, formal languages and
automata, mathematical software and constraint programming. Our success is 
founded on the close integration of theoretical and algorithmic research and 
the development and use of state-of-the-art software.

In 1997, CIRCA became the centre of the development of \GAP after the 
retirement of under~Prof.~J. Neub\"user who initiated the system in 
mid-1980s in Aachen. This move was supported by EPSRC, EU and Leverhulme 
grants. Nowadays, as one of the centres of \GAP\ development, CIRCA has
excellent contacts with developers and users worldwide. 

CIRCA's output includes first class results in Pure Mathematics and in
Computer Science, recognised by our highly-cited publications in top
international venues in both disciplines and our widely used research
software. Beyond the individual international connections of the 
investigators and research staff, CIRCA as a centre has national 
importance and international standing. CIRCA has been selected to host 
major conferences such as CP 2010, BCC 2009, PP 2007, and the 
``Groups St Andrews'' series in 2005 and 2013.

\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}

CIRCA provides hosting for the GAP website and ftp-servers, runs the 
automated system to check, fetch and test updates of GAP packages, uses 
the Jenkins continuous integration system to run regression tests for the 
development version and release candidates on its computer infrastructure, 
and manages GAP releases preparation.
