\subsection*{Université de Versailles -- Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines}

{\bf PRiSM Laboratory.} The research teams of the PRiSM laboratory
(Parall\'elisme, Réseaux, Syst\`emes et Mod\'elisation) are involved
in two main scientific themes of UVSQ: Mathematics and Computer
science on one hand, ``Design, Modelization and Implementation of
Systems'' on the other hand. These two directions are not separated
from each other, as shown by many collaborations with other labs, and
the participation of many PRiSM teams to both directions. Within the
``Mathematics and Computer Science'' theme, the PRiSM teams study
cryptology and security, models for algorithms and operational
research. All the teams also participate to the ``Design, Modelization
and Implementation of Systems'' theme, with a particular focus on
communication systems (networks and telecommunication), embedded
systems, mobile systems, high speed networks, and database systems.

PRiSM is home to the ``Cryptology and Information Security''. In its
research activities, the cryptography team aims at widely covering the
various themes of academic research in cryptology, public key and
secret key cryptography, cryptanalysis, security of implementations,
number theory, multivariate cryptography, hash functions, etc. The
cryptology team brings its specificity in the computer science courses
at UVSQ and, since several years, the university offers several
teaching programs with a part devoted to cryptology and information
security. In particular, the research graduate program ``Applied
Algebra'' offers a full course in cryptology. It has been complemented
by a professional graduate program, called SeCReTS (Security of
Contents, Networks, Telecommunications and Systems). Many activities
of the team, require the use of advanced computer algebra. For this,
the team has a long history of using computer algebra systems (GAP,
Pari, Maple, Magma, ...). In recent years, with the arrival of young
researchers, and with the affirmation of Sage in research and
teaching, the team has moved from a pure user perspective to a
contributor one, taking active part in the development of computer
algebra software.

Current grants:

\begin{enumerate}
\item ANR CLE (2013-2017): Cryptography from Learning with Errors.
  The goal is to propose fast and secure symmetric protocols based on
  the LWE problem.

  (\url{http://idealcodes.github.io/}) spans the three research areas
  of algebraic coding theory, cryptography, and computer algebra, by
  investigating the problem of lattice reduction.
