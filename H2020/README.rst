Compiling the proposal
======================

Compiling the proposal
----------------------

Go in this H2020/ directory, and run:

    make

You can also just compile by hand as a usual LaTeX file:

    pdflatex proposal.tex


LaTeX syntax
------------

Tasks::

   \begin{task}[id=portability,title=Portability]
     ...
   \end{task}

You can use the \localtaskref{portability} inside the same work package
to reference this task or \taskref{management}{portability} outside
(assuming that the task is in a \begin{workpackage}[id=management]
There are macros \localtasktref and \tasktref that also add the title.

Deliverables::

   \begin{wpdeliv}[due=48,id=final-mgt-rep,dissem=R,nature=PU]
        {Project Final Report}
        The final report will a summary of all things in the project
   \end{wpdeliv}

There is a title (in the {}) and - optionally - a text (a couple of
lines) that further describes the deliverable. The nature of the
deliverable should be specified using one of the following codes::

    R = Report, P = Prototype, D = Demonstrator, O = Other

The dissemination level should be specified using one of the following
codes::

    PU = Public
    PP = Restricted to other programme participants (including the Commission Services).
    RE = Restricted to a group specified by the consortium (including the Commission Services).
    CO = Confidential, only for members of the consortium (including the Commission Services).

Bibliography
------------

If you need to add a bibTeX data base foo.bib, please commit it, and
add a line \addbibresource{foo.bib} near the other ones at the top of
proposal.tex. We are using biblatex.sty because it is more versatile.
