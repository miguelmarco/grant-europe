  He has worked on the formal representation and management of mathematical knowledge for
  10 years.  He was a lead researcher in the LATIN project (2009-2012), which produced a
  highly modular and integrated library of formal languages for knowledge representation.
  He is currently a principal investigator in the OAF project, which builds on LATIN to
  produce an archive of libraries of formal mathematical knowledge.

  He is the creator and main developer of the MMT language and system, which are the
  backbone of both LATIN and OAF.  MMT has been developed for 8 years with contributions
  from $>10$ people and currently consists of $>30,000$ lines of Scala code.

  He served in the organization committee of 2 and the program committee of 6
  international conferences (2 as track chair) on intelligent computer mathematics, and
  has organized 4 international workshops on module systems and libraries for mathematical
  knowledge.  He has authored 65 research papers (11 in international journals) and has
  supervised 17 undergraduate and graduate theses.
