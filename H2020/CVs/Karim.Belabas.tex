\begin{participant}[PM=12,salary=7500]{Karim Belabas}
  Professor of Mathematics in Bordeaux (France) since 2005, Karim Belabas is
a senior researcher in Number Theory, with particular interest in
computational and effective aspects. Karim has published about 25 articles
in international journals, including papers in Duke and Compositio (one of
which co-authored with Manjul Bhargava, 2014 Fields Medal), and
edited a book on ``Explicit methods in number theory''.

Karim was head of the Pure Math teaching department in Bordeaux from 2010 to
2014 and is vice-head of the Institut de Math\'ematiques de Bordeaux since
2015. He has held a grant from the French ANR worth $200$ kEuros (ALGOL
project, 2007--2011) and was part of a 2.5MEuros Marie-Curie Research
Training Network (GTEM project 2006--2010); he was responsible for three
deliverables and supervision of an early stage researcher during her PhD in
the Work Package ``Constructive Galois Theory''. He has (co-)organized 8
international conferences, including a special Trimester at IHP in 2004 and
an influential recurrent workshop on ``Explicit methods'' in Oberwolfach
(every two years since 2007) and 5 \PariGP Ateliers. He has (co-)supervised
11 PhD students and about 15 masters students.

Karim is a leading computational number theorist in France. He
is the project leader for the \PariGP free computer algebra system since
1995, which has had a major impact on hundreds of publications. He is one of
the system's main developers (about 60000 lines of code written, most of the
documentation, and 1300 bug-tracking tickets authored).
