\begin{participant}{Nicolas Gama}
  got his PhD in 2009 at École Normale Supérieure. He was appointed Maître de
  Conférences at University of Versailles-St-Quentin-en-Yvelines in 2010.  His research
  interests cover Lattice reduction algorithms, Theory of computer sciences, Algorithmic
  Number Theory, and Cryptology. He has already published 12 papers in international
  journals or refereed international conferences.

  He developed a fork of the NTL library to ease the development of parallel lattice
  algorithms, and added various blockwise lattice primitives, tools like high dimensional
  gaussian sampling over lattices and modulo lattices which can be directly used to
  implement the most recent lattice-based schemes. This fork is scheduled to be merged
  with the main branch of NTL, and the wrapper library for Sage should then be updated
  accordingly.
