  young researcher in Algebraic Combinatorics. She defended her thesis in 2013 and has 3
  papers in international journals and 3 communications in international
  conferences including a talk at PyCon US 2015. Before committing herself to research, 
  she spent two years working in industry as a Java and web developer.

  She discovered Sage during her first sage-days in 2010 and has since been an active user
  and contributor with 10 (co)authored tickets improving the support of combinatorial
  objects into Sage. She is very involved in the promotion of Sage, participating in
