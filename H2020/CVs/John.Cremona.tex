\begin{participant}[PM=3]{John E. Cremona}
  Professor of Mathematics.  DPhil (Oxford, 1981) under Birch.  Previous posts: Michigan,
  Dartmouth (US), Exeter, and Nottingham (as chair and Head of Pure Mathematics). Cremona
  has around 50 publications, including a book and papers in Compositio and Crelle.  He
  has held grants from EPSRC and other UK sources worth \pounds2.5M as well as \euro2.5m
  from the EU for Marie-Curie Research Training Networks in 2000-2004 and 2006-2010.  He
  was a Scientist in Charge of one of twelve teams in both of these networks, and leader
  of the research project ``Effective Cohomology Computations'' in the second.  He has
  been on the Scientific Committee of 30 international conferences (including several Sage
  Days), and given many invited lecture series.  He co-organised semester-long research
  programmes at IHP Paris (2004) and MSRI (2011).  He has been an editor for five
  journals.  He has supervised 16 PhD students, a dozen Masters students, two EU-funded
  postdoctoral fellows and currently has three EPSRC-funded postdoctoral research
  assistants.  Cremona has given over 30 invited conference addresses and seminars in 9
  countries in the last 10 years.

  Cremona's research includes areas of particular relevance to the current project.  His
  methods for systematically enumerating elliptic curves, which are the subject of a book
  and numerous papers, have been used to compile a definitive database of elliptic curves
  which is very widely cited, and now forms part of the LMFDB.  Cremona's experience in
  managing such computations and the management, publication and electronic dissemination
  of the resulting large datasets set a standard which large-scale number-theoretical
  database projects such as the LMFDB now seek to match.  Cremona's experience and
  reputation in this field have been important for the LMFDB project.

  Cremona has been a leading computational number theorist in the UK since his PhD thesis
  in 1981, following in the tradition of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer.  He has written
  thousands of lines of code in his C++ library eclib (one of the standard packages
  included in Sage since its inception) which includes his widely-use program {\tt mwrank}
  for computing ranks of elliptic curves.  As well as writing thousands of lines of new
  python code for Sage, he has also contributed to the active number-theoretical packages
  Pari/GP and Magma.
