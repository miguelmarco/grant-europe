  \TODO{Neil: Can we add something about scientific repeatability and sharing of
    mathematical models? I'm very keen to see systems where I can share a mathematical
    abstraction with a scientist in such a user-friendly way that they feel compelled to
    interact with it and develop their understanding of the modeling more. This might be
    an appropriate place to put this idea.}

The primary objective of this work package is to analyse the ``mutual crowdsourcing''
phenomenon occurring in the framework of development and maintenance of an open-source 
virtual research environment. 
We will focus on identifying the incentives for all
participants of the system, that would encourage sustained development of the
most important parts.  To this end, we will use ideas from the
recent research on crowdsourcing in algorithmic mechanism design.
While doing so, we will apply outcomes to a case study
system.
Further, we will study development models for an academic free software ecosystem,
and analyse how they facilitate the mathematical process behind
relevant  algorithms and databases.
Finally, we will look into the questions of trust in results produced
by computations done by VREs, and ways to mitigate the issues arising there.

\begin{wpdescription}
Crowdsourcing is a recent phenomenon
in software development in particular, but not only there. E.g. 
crowdsourcing of mathematical ideas occurs in online
mathematics communities, such as Math-overflow \cite{mathoverflow} and
in Polymath Projects \cite{polymath}. 
``Mutual crowdsourcing'' is the main driving force
in developing and maintaining of any large-scale open-source 
virtual research environment. 

Open source projects tend to be fragile, in the community sense, and
suffer from disagreements that ultimately result in forks and
the resulting repetition of effort. We will analyse this in 
a setup of cooperative game theory, and try to design
a finely tuned systems of incentives and rewards for contribution, to increase
the stability of the community and its useful output.

We will focus on identifying the appropriate incentives for all
participants of the system, that would encourage sustained development of the
most important parts of the system.  To this end, we will use ideas from the
burgeoning field of mechanism design \cite{AGTbook} and in
particular on recent research on crowdsourcing in algorithmic mechanism design
\cite{crowds}.  While doing so, we will apply outcomes to a case study
system---Sagemath.
We will apply preference and opinion aggregation techniques \cite{pref-aggr} to  develop
a community prioritisation scheme for Sagemath bugs and features requests, which 
are presently being maintained on the Sagemath TRAC server \cite{trac-sagemath}  and implement
them as a TRAC \cite{Trac} add-on.

As well, we will study various development models for an academic free software ecosystem,
and analyse how they facilitate the mathematical process behind algorithms being
designed and implemented,  and databases of experimental data and test cases being
created and expanded.
Trusting results of computer
computations is crucial for usability; channels for communicating bug reports
and fixes need to be carefully analysed from social point of view. 
Commercial closed source computer algebra and other computational systems often
fail to react to bug reports in a timely manner, and seemingly are falling into the
short-sighted trap of hiding bugs from potential and current users \cite{misfort},
Open source  systems are only marginally better in this way, as recent
computer security scares, such as the one around Bash \cite{shellshock}, indicate.
A game-theoretic analysis of this situation will be attempted.

\begin{task}[title=Modern Distribution of Scientific Output]
  \TODO{Neil: a suggested task in this domain, it's an area I've been thinking about a lot and it could fit in here. }
  The current model for distribution of scientific output stems from an era when the printing press was dominant. The process has become formalized through peer review and publication of journals. The PDF format for distribution of documents reflects the status quo, that a scientific paper is a written as if for printing and remains an unchanging document. In scientific blogging we are seeing that more rapid propagation of ideas can occur when the constrains of the printed format are released, however, there is a lack of formalization that means attribution of ideas and commentary run amiss. We will develop tools and ideas for distribution of scientific knowledge that don't rely on a static format and allow for the full spectrum of scientific debate. The tools will encourage proper credit attribution through encouraging sharing of attribution for ideas, software and data.
  \TOWRITE{NL}{One deliverable simple idea would be to enable the construction of 'Living Posters' which can be interacted with, targeted at large touch screens.}
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Survey and collection of needed data,id=datacollection]
We will survey the data needed to assess development models of 
large-scale academic open-source projects, 
such that the probable correlation between the size of the atomic contribution
vs. the speed of the contribution making it into the code, 
and collect appropriate statistical data. The latter will require non-trivial
amount of programming work, even only for the test system, Sagemath.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Collective decision making in development,id=decisionmaking]
Currently development of open-source academic software is task-driven, where tasks (also
known as tickets) are posted on a website, and their priorities are set in an ad hoc manner.
Whereas the latter might be good enough for simple bug fixing, for more elaborate task this
often leads to delays etc.
We would like to investigate an voting-driven approach, where the priorities are being
voted on by the developer community, and possibly the people who completed tasks
are incentivised in some form (e.g. by ``karma points'', as on Mathoverflow).
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=OOMMF case study: Evaluation]
  % 4 person months, 1 person month investigator time
  We will start to make the \OOMMFNB{} code (see
  \taskref{UI}{oommf-python-interface} to
  \taskref{UI}{oommf-tutorial-and-documentation}) available as open
  source to micromagnetic community research groups as early as
  possible
  (\taskref{dissem}{dissemination-of-oommf-nb-virtual-environment}) to
  gather feedback on its usefulness over a period as long as
  achievable. We will use this case study data to support our study of
  social aspects of mutual crowdsourcing.

  A survey will be developed and used to gather user input and
  feedback on usefulness of the provided capabilities, with particular
  focus on where \OOMMFNB{} enables new and better science, where it
  allows to do work more effectively and reproducibly, and the role of
  community contributions. We will further gather suggestions for
  improvements, and this feedback will be evaluated continuously and
  where possible re-acted on. We will \texttt{target OOMMF-NB} users
  that attend workshops (see task
  \taskref{dissem}{dissemination-of-oommf-nb-workshops}). All results
  and insights will be summarised in a report (\delivref{social-aspects}{oommf-nb-evaluation}) to share the lessons
  learned from this user interface application example, and be made
  publicly available. Where possible, we will report our findings at
  relevant workshops/conferences.
