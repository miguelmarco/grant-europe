  The objective of this work package is to organize and optimize the
  communication with the larger community. This includes:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item reviewing emerging technologies;
  \item disseminating research results to the scientific community;
  \item ensuring awareness of the results in the user community;
  \item raising general public awareness of the \TheProject project;
  \item defining individual exploitation plans; and,
  \item managing existing and new intellectual property.
  \end{itemize}

\end{wpdescription}

\begin{tasklist}
\begin{task}[title=Reviewing emerging technologies]
  In this task, we will produce periodic reviews of emerging
  technologies and relevant developments elsewhere, and implications
  for our plans. This include the review of standard components and
  service for storage and sharing, computational resources,
  authentication, package management, etc. This may further include
  negotiating access or shared development when appropriate. This
  information will be fed to the other work packages, in particular
  Work Package~\WPref{component-architecture} Component Architecture.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Dissemination and Communication activities]

  \TODO{scale this down as appropriate}

  This task comprises all forms of direct dissemination and public
  communication activities such as press releases, creation of the
  project web-site including visitor analysis and monitoring tools
  (\delivref{website}), scientific and technical publications, outreach
  activities (seminars, keynote talks, media interviews, press
  releases), pro- motion through social media (e.g. twitter, Facebook,
  linkedin), technical workshop organisation, creation of
  advertisement materials such as flyers, posters, and electronic
  feeds as well as their distribution.

  % News articles will be produced by experienced professional staff
  % at relevant partners including ... and communicated to local,
  % national and international media, as appropriate.

  At least two press releases will be generated in the course of the
  project (\delivref{pressrelease}, \delivref{finalpressrelease}), and
  the project will organise at least one open technical workshop each
  year. % In fact many more?
  
  \TODO{Neil: This coming year I will do four workshops, although the number may be smaller by the time we are up and running. An additional component that could be integrated here is a 'JMLR Monthly Notices' section that I recently gained approval for. This is a new section the leading machine learning journal that we'll aim to focus on typically smaller advances (less than a full paper). A little like a 'Nature Notices' section but much more informal and open. We don't yet know the best way of doing it, but the mechanism might be similar to ways we'd want to disseminate DreamKit results.}

\begin{task}[id=dissemination-of-oommf-nb-virtual-environment,
  title=Open source dissemination of \OOMMFNB{} virtual environment]
  % 4 months person time + 1 months investigator time
  \OOMMFNB{} (see \taskref{UI}{oommf-python-interface} to
  \taskref{UI}{oommf-tutorial-and-documentation}) is build on top of \TheProject and demonstrates the power
  of the environment in a production environment of active OOMMF users. 
  The source code of \OOMMFNB{} will be made available as open source on
  public repository hosting sites (such as github/bitbucket), and
  announced to the community via appropriate mailing list (mumag,
  magpar, nmag, mumax, micromagnum) and other means. We will
  encourage participation of the micromagnetic community in the
  maintenance and development of the tools, and allow time to train
  users to join the \OOMMFNB{} project to drive towards a self-sustained
  \OOMMFNB{} project at the end of the funding period.

  To underpin this process, we will set up a publicly accessible
  Jenkins/Travis continuous integration (CI) system to (i) run
  regression tests (from \taskref{UI}{oommf-python-interface} and \taskref{UI}{oommf-py-ipython-attributes}) routinely when the
  \OOMMFNB{} code changes or OOMMF core code changes and (ii)
  re-execute notebooks (from
  \taskref{UI}{oommf-tutorial-and-documentation}) and use
  as regression test (making using of the outcome of task \taskref{UI}{notebook-verification}). This will
  test user-contributions automatically, and can automatically create virtual environments
  for download that containing the latest versions (\delivref{dissem}{oommfnb-source-and-testing-setup}).

  We will create a manuscript for journal publication (\delivref{dissem}{oommfnb-publication}), summarising the
  approach taken and experience gathered so far. An important point of
  this publication is to provide a reference that can be cited by
  publications making use of the new \OOMMFNB, allowing tracking of
  uptake of this technology in the medium and long run.

  In this task, we run a series of workshops (\delivref{dissem}{oommfnb-workshops}) at major international
  meetings to disseminate the open source \OOMMFNB{} tool (see 
%\taskref{UI}{oommf-python-interface} to
%\taskref{UI}{oommf-tutorial-and-documentation} and 
\localtaskref{dissemination-of-oommf-nb-virtual-environment}) in the
  micromagnetic community.

  We will prepare the software stack for the workshops, develop
  teaching materials, and do the planning (location, advertising,
  registration) and delivery of workshops at the 4 most significant
  international meetings taking place in the appropriate time
  frame\footnote{Anticipated major meetings are 61st Conference on
    Magnetism and Magnetic Materials October 31-November 4, 2016, New
    Orleans, Louisiana; 62nd Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic
    Materials November 6-10, 2017, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; 21st
    International Conference on Magnetism (ICM 2018) July 16â€“20, 2018,
    San Francisco, California; 14th Joint MMM-Intermag Conference
    January 14-18, 2019, Washington, DC). Each of those meetings is
    one week long, and serves as a focal point of networking for the
    european and international research community.} each of which
  tends to attract around 1500 attendees. Depending on demand,
  multiple workshops will be given per conference, i.e. one workshop
  per evening. We anticipate to travel with two people (Hans Fangohr
  and PDRA or other support staff) to be able to teach effectively and
  deliver hands-on training as part of the workshop. The taught
  material will include (i) use of the \OOMMFNB{} workflow model to
  support effective and reproducible computational science.  
  To support to make the \OOMMFNB{} project self-sustaining and to
  maximise the value of this initial develop, we will also teach an
  (ii) introduction to the standard techniques for contribution to
  open source software (version control, pull requests, testing
  frameworks).  In addition, all teaching materials, including videos,
  will be made available on a website.

  We request 500 EUR room hire per meeting to support delivery of
  these workshops directly at the international meetings.

\begin{task}[title=Demonstrator: interactive books,
id=ibook]
  % 2x12 _ 3x 3 months for students

One of important elements of VRE is a common flexible format which
enables the creation of large structured documents. There are many
known solutions to that problem, but they usually compromise the
interactivity of the notebook interface and quality of desktop
publishing software like LaTeX. 

Recently, few approaches tried to bring both interactivity and the
typographic features. Modestly tagged markup language implementation
DocOnce targets the problem of reusability of the document source
code. The MathBook XML is a lightweight XML application for authors of
scientific articles, textbooks and monographs extensively using Sage
single cells for interactive elements. Sphinx documentation software
has been successfully applied for creation of interactive books
containing Sage cells using sagecell plugin. 

The technical aspects of format for interactive publications is a
subject of the task ``Structured documents'' in
\taskref{UI}{structdocs}. In this task we will demonstrate usability
of the results of \taskref{UI}{structdocs} in creation of scientific
textbooks. Three interactive books will be created:

\begin{itemize}
\item Nonlinear Processes in Biology 
\item Classical Mechanics  
\item Problems  in Physics with Sage/python    
\end{itemize}

The choice of those particular topics has been made for the sake of maximal diversity. The ``Nonlinear Processes in Biology'' will heavily use numerical ODE and PDE integration with addition to the classical approach. Classical Mechanics will demonstrate power of CAS systems working ``on par'' with numerical tools. The last example will focus mostly on collaborative editing and modularity of content which is produced using VRE technologies. 

The main research aspect for this task will be to find a way for efficient application of computational tools in problems solving and analysis. In addition the work-flow will be optimized in order to explore the full potential of VRE environment. 

In particular we will answer following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item How to create a monograph at reusing independently working   building block of text and code?
\item When the interactive worksheet should be used and when  executable code cell inside interactive textbook is sufficient?
\item What are best tools and practices for using single source for with many output targets? 
\item How to collaboratively write reusable course materials?
\item How students can benefit from  using VRE as working tool?
\end{itemize}


\end{task}

\end{tasklist}



Raw material:
\begin{itemize}
\item Documentation improvements: overview, cross links, overview of
  recent improvements
\item Thematic tutorials
\item Collections of pedagogical documents\\
  E.g. a complete collection of interactive class notes with computer
  lab projects for the ``AlgÃ¨bre et Calcul formel'' option of the
  French math aggregation (starting from 2014-2015, only open-source
  systems will be supported, and Sage is a major player).
  % See http://nicolas.thiery.name/Enseignement/Agregation/ as a starter
  % Math labs with Sage for first year students in France (L1): http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~omarguin/
\item Localization of the Sage user interface and key documents in
  various European languages.
\item Distribution of the documents either in the main distribution of
  Sage or through the online repository (see collaborative tools).
\item Massive online introduction course to Sage, drawing on the sage tutorial/notebooks.
Could be "First year Sage course in a box".
\item Taking the opportunity of Python courses to propose Sage as a natural extension
for mathematics; an example is French's 
% TODO: The url macro eats the accented letters. 
% It doesn't just eat it, it pukes it back!
``Classes pr\'eparatoires''\footnote{
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_prÃ©paratoire_aux_grandes_Ã©coles}}, 
where Python has been recently selected as the language to learn programming\footnote{See 
the ``Annexe'' at 
\url{http://www.education.gouv.fr/pid25535/bulletin_officiel.html?cid_bo=71586}}.
%\item \TODO{please expand!}
\end{itemize}

% Jeroen: About teaching: in Gent, Sage is already integrated in the
% courses (maybe you can add this, don't know if it's relevant)
% starting in the first year. It's good for the students because it
% helps in 2 ways: it helps them to understand the mathematics better
% and it helps them to learn basic down-to-earth programming (they
% also have a programming course in Java but that contains a lot of
% theory about complicated class structures)
% Same thing in Orsay
% More python centered but same in UZH
% We have also Sage @ Silesia from 1st semester (physics)
