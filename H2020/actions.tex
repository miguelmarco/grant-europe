\section{Actions}
\subsection{Collaborative tools}

\begin{itemize}
\item Development of an online repository for indexing and sharing
  notebooks and other Sage resources.
  %\TODO{Be clearer: we want to get rid of notebooks over the
  %  filesystem and .sws tarball}
\item Workflow improvements: continuous integration, ...
%\item \TODO{please expand!}
\item Sharing best practices and tools between sister projects (GAP, ...)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deployment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Live USB keys
\end{itemize}
 % http://sagedebianlive.metelu.net/

\subsection{Community animation and training}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sage Days (training workshops and developers meetings)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \TODO{<put suggestions of locations / dates here>}
  \end{itemize}
\item Exchange visits for students, researchers, ... in between
  partner institutions, and with developers worldwide
\item Strengthening of collaborations with sister projects: GAP,
  Linbox, Singular, \PariGP, IPython, Scientific Python, R, to name but a
  few.
\item \TODO{please expand}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Math features}

\begin{itemize}
\item Foundation work: categories, morphisms, coercion, ...
\item Generic parallelism tools for combinatorics

  % More support for group theory (especially free group automorphisms, mapping class group of surfaces, braid groups)
\item Symbolic dynamical systems (substitutive systems, Bratelli diagrams,
  sofic shifts, tilings, interval exchange transformations)
\item Manifolds (symbolic computations in charts, differential equations, etc)
  % http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/
