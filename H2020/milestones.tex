The work in the \TheProject project is structured by seven milestones, which coincide with
the project meetings in summer and fall.  Since the meetings are the main face-to-face
interaction points in the project, it is suitable to schedule the milestones for these
events, where they can be discussed in detail. We envision that this setup will give the
project the vital coherence in spite of the broad mix of disciplinary backgrounds of the
participants.

\begin{milestones}
  \milestone[id=kickoff,verif=Inspection,month=1]
    {Initial Infrastructure}
    {Set up the organizational infrastructure, in particular: Web Presence, project TRAC,\ldots}
  \milestone[id=consensus,verif=Inspection,month=24]{Consensus} {Reach Consensus on the
    way the project goes}
  \milestone[id=exploitation,verif=Inspection,month=36]{Exploitation}{The exploitation
    plan should be clear so that we can start on this in the last year.}
  \milestone[id=final,verif=Inspection,month=48]{Final Results}{all is done}
\end{milestones}
