\section{Excellence}

\TheProject focuses on delivering tools that will make it easy to setup Virtual Research
Environments, customized to meet the diverse needs of collaborative
research in pure mathematics and applications, and built out of a
sustainable ecosystem of % both domain-specific and general purpose
community-developed open software, databases, and services.

The remarkable emergence and success in the last decade(s) of a large
ecosystem of community-developed computational software like
e.g.\ \GAP, \Linbox, \PariGP, \Sage, or \Singular and of interactive
scientific computing environments like \IPython showcase the viability
of community development models for such components.

The recent successes of the Virtual Research and Teaching Environment
\SMC (hosting more than 10k users and 100k projects after just
one year) and of the online number theory database LMFDB showcase the
strong need for \textbf{integrated solutions} enabling large-scale
collaboration on \textbf{software}, \textbf{knowledge}, and \textbf{data}.

Yet setting up infrastructures like those mentioned above currently requires
massive ad-hoc efforts. Challenges include portability, compatibility,
performance, usability, reproducibility, not to mention the many
social aspects involved in communities and ecosystems thereof.


A specific challenge in mathematics comes from the vast yet tightly
connected array of concepts involved. Different groups of researchers
may have radically different needs, workflows, and resources, calling
for a highly modular and customizable VRE infrastructure.

\TheProject will attack all those challenges upfront, while
consolidating Europe's leading position in this field.

\TODO{Better explain the specific needs in maths, and why we focus on
  VRE building blocks rather than VRE themselves, in the DIY spirit.}

%Does the following help with the TODO?
In particular, we will focus on developing and improving building
blocks of e-infrastructure that can be assembled and re-used flexibly
to address a wide range of requirements in mathematics and the
applications of mathematics in science and engineering, rather than
creating one particular monolithic environment.

% The development of effective, flexible and easy-to-use VRE technology
% is especially important for mathematicians, because their research
% groups tend to be small and can be isolated.

% \TODO{Reference this last claim? Maybe expand a little more,
% or justify later}

\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sect:objectives}

\eucommentary{1-2 pages}
\eucommentary{\emph{Describe the specific objectives for the project,
which should be clear, measurable, realistic and achievable within the
duration of the project. Objectives should be consistent with the expected
exploitation and impact of the project (see section 2).}}

The specific aims of \TheProject are:


\begin{enumerate}[\textbf{Aim} 1:]
\item \label{aim:collaboration} Improve the productivity of
  researchers in pure mathematics and applications by promoting
  collaborations based on mathematical \textbf{software},
  \textbf{data}, and \textbf{knowledge}.
\item \label{aim:vre} Make it easy for teams of
  researchers of any size to setup custom collaborative Virtual Research
  Environments tailored to their needs, resources and workflows, supporting the
  entire life-cycle of computational work in mathematical research,
  from initial exploration to publication, teaching and outreach.
  % and bridge the gaps between
  % code, published results, and educational material.
\item \label{aim:sharing} Identify and promote best practices in
  computational mathematical research, including making results easily
  reproducible, producing reusable and easily accessible
  software, sharing data in a semantically sound way and exploiting and
  supporting the growing ecosystem of computational tools.
\item \label{aim:impact} Maximize sustainability as well as impact in
  mathematics, neighboring fields, and scientific computing.

\TODO{HF: Aim 3 seems rather crowded. Should we filter out 'reproducibility' and move this into Aim 4 (impact)? Or create a new aim?}
\end{enumerate}



Our research will cover a wide variety of aspects, ranging from
software development models, user interfaces \TODO{virtual
  environments?}, deployment frameworks and novel collaborative tools,
component architecture, design, and standardization of software
\TODO{system?} and databases, to links to publication, data archival
and reproducibility of experiments, development models and tools, and

\item\label{objective:framework} To develop and standardize
  an architecture allowing a range of mathematical and
  data and software components to be combined 
  with off-the-shelf non-mathematical infrastructure to produce
  specialized VREs for different research communities. The
  architecture will take the form of standards documents and APIs
  equipped, where appropriate, with formal or informal mathematical
  semantics to ensure interactions are mathematically sound. This primarily
  addresses aim \ref{aim:vre}, thereby contributing to aims
  \ref{aim:collaboration} and~\ref{aim:sharing}. \TODO{This is a bit long}

\item\label{objectives:core} To develop open source core components
  for such VREs where existing software is not  or not suitable. These

  \ref{aim:collaboration} and~\ref{aim:sharing}.

  \TOWRITE{SL}{objective:core: Write detailed description}

\item \label{objective:community} To bring together related research
  communities (such as users of IPython, \Sage, \Singular, and \GAP)
  to symbiotically exploit overlaps in tool creation building efforts,
  to avoid duplication of effort in different disciplines, and to
  benefit from best-practice pioneered in one community by sharing it
  most effectively. This supports Aims~\ref{aim:collaboration},
  \ref{aim:sharing} and~\ref{aim:impact}.


\item \label{objective:updates} Update a range of existing open source
  mathematical software systems for seamless deployment and efficient
  execution within the VRE architecture of objective~\ref{objective:framework}.
  This fulfills part of Aim~\ref{aim:vre}.

  development best practices, and outsourcing development to larger
  communities whenever suitable. This fulfills part of
  Aim~\ref{aim:sharing} and~\ref{aim:impact}.

\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objective:framework}: Virtual Research
  Environment Kit}\ 

Computational techniques have become a core asset for research in pure
  mathematics and its applications in the last decades. Mathematics
  communities have come together to develop powerful computational
  tools, such as GAP, \PariGP, SAGE or Singular, and valuable on-line
  services such as the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences and the ATLAS
  of Group Representations. \TODO{cite} In building these systems, 
  mathematicians have gained strong
  experience in collaborative software development, with pioneering
  work and continuing leadership of Europe.

A number of approaches to linking these resources have been developed,
such as the SCSCP protocol from the Framework 6 SCIEnce project, and
the incorporation of a variety of free software tools in the SAGE
system, but the overall model is still that of a single mathematician
running programs or interacting with a ``notebook''
page. The software provides little or no support for other aspects of
mathematical research: collaboration,
archival, reproducibility or linkage between programs, data and
publication. Databases are updated mainly by mathematicians directly,
retaining no record of the source of new entries, and providing no way
of referring to the actual version of the data used in a particular
computation.

The first objective of this project is to design an architecture which
will allow existing mathematical software systems (suitably updated), 
off-the shelf non-mathematical tools and a small number of new
components to be flexibly combined to produce a VRE that will
effectively support collaborative mathematical research throughout
it's entire life-cycle. This will include software APIs and standards,
frameworks for assuring the semantic consistency of similar
mathematical objects in different systems.  It will be informed by the
outputs of objective \ref{objective:social}, ensuring that the VREs
fit the ways that mathematicians actually work.

\TODO{Keyword: flexible/versatile virtual environment. Does this
  belong here}

Our research will cover a wide variety of aspects, ranging from
software development models, user interfaces \TODO{virtual
  environments?}  deployment frameworks and novel collaborative tools,
component architecture, design, and standardization of software
components and databases, to links to publication, data archival and
reproducibility of experiments, development models and tools, and
social aspects. It will build on the remarkable success of the open
source ecosystem and consolidate Europe's leading position in
computational mathematics.

Following the call specifications, all software, data, and
publications resulting from this proposal will be open.



\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objective:core}: Core components}\

Most of the direct mathematical capabilities of our software will come
from existing or updated open source mathematical systems. For instance we will
use the power of the GAP Library for computational group theory or
\PariGP for number theory. Generic services such as storage, version
control, authentication and resource accounting will come from
off-the-shelf components building on standard infrastructures. 

Nevertheless some new or adapted tools will be needed. One example is
a general infrastructure for mathematical databases, covering some of
the types of data values and search criteria common in mathematics,
but rare outside, and issues such as provenance and citation that are
common to most mathematical databases. Other examples include adapting
user interface and collaboration tools to support mathematical notations.




\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objective:community}: Community building across disciplines}\ 


Open source tools are developed with great effect across different
communities often leading to re-inventions and re-implementations of
great ideas by different people not being aware of each other. By
fostering a more cross-discipline community, by sharing tools where
possible and by creating slightly more generic tools that can be shared,
we will reduce such duplication of effort significantly. This will
also lead to better quality software as the maintenance and
development effort can be focused on one tool rather than a wide
spread of codes, allow sharing of innovative ideas and practice more
efficiently, and increasing productivity of research substantially.

While each of the communities such as \Sage, \Singular, and \GAP need
somewhat special features for their research, they are united through
being (i)~focussed on mathematical challenges, (ii)~needing a
computational workflow. \IPython and the \Jupyter Notebook are used
widely in communities outside mathematics in Science and Engineering
that also need the computational workflow and are based on
(iii)~applications of mathematics. These three common attributes are
sufficient to distill the requirements for core features of the
virtual research environment described in this \TheProject{}
proposal. Community building will also help to sustain ongoing and
community driven maintenance of a such a tool.



\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objective:updates}: Updates to Mathematical
  Software components}\ 
Essential to our vision is leveraging the communities massive
decades-long investment in a range of open source mathematical
software systems. These systems are complex, widely used and powerful,
but generally designed for operation as stand-alone programs, not as
part of an integrated VRE. Many are also not well-suited for modern
platforms, needing work to better support parallel programming,
virtualization and HPC platforms. We will update these systems to work
together seamlessly and comply with best practice for portability and
platform integration.


\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objective:sustainable}: A sustainable
  ecosystem of software components}\ 

The success of large specialized software like \PariGP, \Singular or
\GAP in the last decades has shown the viability of the academic open
source development model for such. For a long time, it was bitterly
debated whether this model would have any chance to scale to general
purpose systems for pure mathematics. The rapid takeoff of Sage in the
last decade has proven the viability of the ``developed by users for
users'' model: despite its large international community of about 150
active developers, it's running on a tiny specific budget, with most
activities being funded indirectly by research grants that require
specific development.

This was made possible by reusing existing components whenever
possible (e.g. hundreds of specialized open source math libraries, or
the \Python programming language with its developers tools and huge
library), by spinning off software development (e.g. the \Cython
compiler) to larger communities whenever possible, and by carefully
designing the development workflow.

Yet, long term critical non mathematical features like portability,
modularization, packaging, user interfaces, large data, parallelism,
or outreach toward related software, have been lagging behind. Indeed
they can hardly be implemented as a side product of research projects,
and \textbf{need to be assigned to a few full time developers}. Regular
funding is also needed to better structure the computational
mathematics community in Europe and support its upcoming major
widening through training, development workshops, exchanges, ...

\textbf{One purpose of this grant is to initiate this process and
  invest on the long run to reduce the recurrent needs.}

The principle is that, with the growth of the user base, a tiny number
of institutions or companies will hire a full-time developer to
support critical needs of their in-house research or development.
Opportunities for such hiring are for example actively investigated at
the Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique. It should be noted that,
at the scale of a large university, the cost of licenses for analogous
commercial software can reach the same order of magnitude as that of a
developer.

%\TODO{Examples: LRI? Full time devs supported by research grant, like
%  for Linbox? Others?}

To reduce the number of required full time developers \TheProject will
invest toward, factoring out joint needs, and outsourcing or spinning
off more components to larger communities.
%
For example, \TheProject will save much recurrent efforts to the
mathematics community by providing a temporary boost to outsource the
development of the user interface of each computational component to
\IPython and make \IPython stand to the stringent needs of the
community.  Later on, thanks to its large user base both in academia
and industry, \IPython will continue to thrive without specific
funding or major contributions from the mathematics community.

\TheProject will also foster the productivity within the ecosystem by
investigating better collaboration processes between components, and
identifying, sharing, and promoting software development best
practices.

\TOWRITE{VP}{objective:disseminate: detailed description}

The success of any research software or service is strongly related to its ability to attract and convince a great amount of users. Our different communities (Sage, Gap, \PariGP, Singular...) have developed a solid experience and network. As an example, Sage has gathered thousands of users in less than 10 years. This was achieved thanks to a very strong community building philosophy, especially through the organization of Sage-Days all over the world. The first Sage-days happened in 2006, today we count 63 of them, including 10 for 2014 only, and also Sage Education days, Sage Bug days, Sage Doc days and more. Most of us, \TheProject{} project members, have been involved in these events either as organizers or participants and it appears as the most efficient way to promote our software. More precisely, our objective is to create constant dialogue with the different communities: frequent workshops, conferences, user groups, mailing lists. By building on existing tools, we intend to involve the communities in the development process itself in the spirit of open-source software. 

We also intend to reach a larger crowd of researchers by cutting down non-research technical issues to access existing tools: building better documentation and tutorials, developing easy-to-install distributions, easy web and cloud access, better user interfaces, better interactions between different software. Doing so, our objective is to help the communities to grow themselves and interact together using our work.

\subsection{Ethics}

\eucommentary{
If you have entered any ethics issues in the ethical issue table in the administrative proposal forms, you must:\\
$\bullet$ submit an ethics self-assessment, which: \\
-- describes how the proposal meets the national legal and ethical requirements of the
country or countries where the tasks raising ethical issues are to be carried out;\\
-- explains in detail how you intend to address the issues in the ethical issues table, in
particular as regards:
research objectives (e.g. study of vulnerable populations, dual use, etc.),
research methodology (e.g. clinical trials, involvement of children and related
consent procedures, protection of any data collected, etc.),
the potential impact of the research (e.g. dual use issues, environmental damage,
stigmatisation of particular social groups, political or financial retaliation,
benefit-sharing, malevolent use , etc.)\\
$\bullet$ provide the documents that you need under national law (if you already have them), e.g.:\\
-- an ethics committee opinion;\\
-- the document notifying activities raising ethical issues or authorizing such activities\\
If these documents are not in English, you must also submit an English summary of them
(containing, if available, the conclusions of the committee or authority concerned).\\
If you plan to request these documents specifically for the project
you are proposing, your request must contain an explicit reference to the project title}
