General project meetings
========================

Should take place every 6 months -> 9 meetings in total.

Should rotate through partner sites

Should be combined with workshops/other technical meetings where possible.


Kick-off meeting October 2015 in Orsay (France), (Project meeting 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Organizer: Nicolas/Viviane

Themes:
- Get to know each other
- Start working together on the user interface side (one way or the
  other, basically everyone is involved in this ).
- Technichal introduction to different projects (Sage, HPC, SMC, IPython...)

Participants: about 20 people (project participants + people from IPython / SMC / ...)

Potential future meetings
-------------------------

Sites for general project meetings:
- Orsay x 2
- Saint Andrews
- Kaiserslautern
- Oxford
- Warwick
- Simula
- Zürich?
- Bremen
- Grenoble? Bordeaux? University of Silesia?

Women in OpenDreams / Scientific development
============================================

Analogs of the Women in Sage series (http://wiki.sagemath.org/days62)

One per year?

Opportunities to be explored:
- combined event with "Femmes et Mathématiques"?
- thematics: Sage, SMC, linear algebra

Localization: Orsay, Oxford?, ???


Training workshops
==================

At least two per year? One in "pure math" and a more general on IPython?

Typically 40 people

Opportunities:
- Graduate student training program of GDR-IM in France
- CIRM, Oberwolfach, RISC, ...

Notes from Neil on the IPython Workshops
========================================

For IPython ones we could also do them with a bit more of a data science flavour. In Sheffield we already run courses in methodologies that use the IPython notebook. But we would like to start running short courses on *interactive research* with the IPython notebook. This would be very appropriate for this grant.

IPython - OOMMF Workshops
=========================

Workshops to run at the biggest 4 international meetings on magnetism
(each attracting around 1500 attendees) to disseminate the OOMMF-NB
work (from User Interface packages). We expect to teach (i) the
OOMMF-NB interface and (ii) basics of open source technology to help
the community to contribute in future. We will run the workshop(s) in
the evening of the conference when there are no other events and it is
easy to all interested attendees to come to that. Given sufficient
demand, we can run multiple versions of this workshop. We shoul count
this as 4 workshops (although it may end up to be 8 or 12 due to large
numbers of participants). We are probably looking at a 3h event; maybe
6 (if we split open source basics and application training into two
evenings, each being 3h).

These workshops are listed in the Disemmination work package.
