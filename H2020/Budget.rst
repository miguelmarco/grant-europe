Guidance for budgeting travel expenses
======================================

As a consortium, we should request identical amounts of money for all
our activities where this is reasonable, and deviate it from it where
necessary and explainable.

Common activities include

- conference attendance
- project meetings
- coding sprints
- visits at partner sites
- inviting visitors from outside the project.


Cost guidelines per activity
----------------------------

Conferences, visits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suggested costs for these categories:

Conference attendance: we split these into EU conferences and overseas
(overseas as in 'away from Europe') and suggest

- 2200 EUR for an overseas conference  (assumes 1-week trip)

- 1200 EUR for an EU conference / work shop (assumes 1-week trip)

- 750 EUR for a visit to a EU partner per week, such as for coding
  sprints, one-to-one visits for particular research.

- 750 EUR per week to invite people from outside the project.

The actual expenses will vary: for example, we expect that it is more
expensive to travel from Oslo (distance) or the UK (island) to
Karlsruhe than it is from France, but once partners from Germany or
France have to travel to Oslo or the UK, they will face similar costs,
and it is good if our numbers look consistent. If this turns out to be
unbalanced, then those with more spare resources can pay, for example,
accommodation for incoming visitors to correct this - in the end we
are all aiming for good science and are likely to help each other out
to achieve this together. For now, we need to maximise the chances of
getting the funding.

See below for recommended frequency of these events. 



Max frequency of events
-----------------------

Project meetings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Allow 400 EUR per person per project to attend 6-monthly project
  meetings (i.e. 800 EUR per year).

  [Those organising the project meetings should budget money to
  provide accommodation to attendees.]


Conference attendance frequency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We generally engage with two communities: (i) the tools/open source
(Python, PyCon, EuroPython, SciPy), and (ii) discipline specific
(Maths, science, engineering, etc). It is important to engage with
the tools/open source community to network, collaborate,
contribute and exploit latest trends and important to stay in touch
with the application domain to disseminate the MathVRE project and to
keep in touch with the state-of-the-art developments and needs.


As a guideline we suggest:

- 1 international conferences, and 2 european conferences, per year for each person
  working full time on the project 
- 1 international conference and 1 european meeting for each
  investigator per year


Where we have multiple investigators per site, the 'investigator'
money may have to be shared between the investigators to avoid
unreasonable total costs.


Partner visits and workshop attendance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One-to-One partner site visits: For every partner, expect 3-4 visits per
year for one person to other partner sites. (i.e. 2 x 750EUR per
year). This is also used to attend workshops, so that the visit
coincides with the workshop where possible.


Visitors
~~~~~~~~

Inviting visitors from outside the consortium, also to host interns or
others that contribute value to the project

- Allowing the equivalent of about 3 weeks (2000 EUR) per year per site



Organising training and development workshops (including sprints)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Training workshops are more difficult: they engage different
communities, and will have different requirements. Some data from the
past Sage days:

The usual, quite successful, format of Sage days is 5 days, 2-3 with
presentations, and the rest just working hard. Or sometimes just 5
days of coding.

       http://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops

The budget for our yearly developers meeting in Orsay: roughly 4k euros
for the local expenses for 12 people, that's about 350EUR per person
to accommodate them and provide food. We achieve this by renting a big
house and cooking ourselves (which also has strong community building
virtues):

       http://wiki.sagemath.org/days57

To engage others (i.e. non-project members from the community), we can
ask for additional funds. In the pags or traditional Sage days, a
budget of 16k euros for about 40 people, allowed to pay for the travel
and accommodation of some good proportion of the participants, with a
priority on invited people and graduate students, i.e. 400 EUR per
attendee.

The recommendation is that work shop organisers ask for money to host
the work shop (some guidance numbers above in this section) but take
into account what is realistic: what does it cost to host 10 / 20 / 30
/ 40 people for a week in your area, etc.

Expect that attendees will pay their own travel, but rely on
accommodation and catering from you.


Hardware 
--------

If you can't recover this from the indirect cost this: add note on
needing a high-end laptop 2000 EUR per person per site. This may include
buying a hardware refresh half way through the project.


Travel expenses example
-----------------------

Assume you have one investigator (I) and one FullTime Equivalent person
(FTE) on the project for four years.

The annual (!) travel costs following the guidelines above would be:

1 international conferences (FTE) + 1 international conference (I)-> 2*2200 EUR
2 EU conferences (FTE) + 1 EU conference (I) -> 3*1200 EUR
4 weeks of visiting other sites -> 4*750 EUR
2 project meetings (FTE) + 2 project meetings (I) -> 4*400
Money to host visitors -> 2000

Totals (2*2200 + 3*1200 + 4*750 + 4*400 + 2000)  = 14600

Over 4 years, that is 

(2*2200 + 3*1200 + 4*750 + 4*400 + 2000) * 4 = 58400 


While the total amount request needs to be specified via the portal
and spreadsheets (the EU support offices/ finance teams should know),
it is not clear where exactly in the submission we need to explain how the travel cost
is budgeted, i.e. on what basis we request that money [which is
basically what is described above]. Does anybody know?
