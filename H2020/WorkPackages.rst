Work Package Clusters
=====================

Overview – develop and validate a software architecture building on
relevant prior art, techniques from other communities, etc. into which
a wide range of components can be plugged to develop flexible bespoke
VREs for particular communities and projects.

Standardisation
---------------

Either as a package by itself, or subpackage of the previous one.

- API's
- Possibly building on OpenMath / SCSCP / ...
- Notebook formats
- Virtualization


Supporting the Mathematical Process
-----------------------------------

Collaboration tools, links to publication and archival, etc.
appropriate roles for proof/programme checking [does this belong here]

Includes one or two demonstrator deliverables (or make them related
WPs) If we have a publisher, maybe split that part out to give them a
WP to lead Informed by the social stuff.

Interactions with proof systems and proof assistants (reach toward
Calculemus / Theorema / Coq / Gonthier's team / ...).

Development Models for an Academic Free Software Ecosystem
----------------------------------------------------------

Sharing best practices, practices that respect academic requirements
(credit etc.)  development models that embrace more than one project –
has social and technical aspects

Next Generation Mathematical Databases
--------------------------------------

Social Aspects
--------------

Studying how collaboration, publication, acceptance, linking
computations to publications etc could work in the real community

Studying social aspects of mathematical software development models


Other Possible Packages
=======================

Management, dissemination etc.

Dissemination
-------------
