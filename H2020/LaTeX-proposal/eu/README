euproposal.cls: A class for preparing FP7 proposals for collaborative projects

The euproposal class supports many of the specific elements of a Framework 7 Proposal. It
is optimized towards collaborative projects. The package comes with extensive examples. To
start a new proposal just copy a suitable one and modify it to your needs. Note that the
structure of EU proposals changes from time to time, so that the examples may be out of
date.
